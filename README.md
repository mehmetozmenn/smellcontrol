üöÄ SmellControl: Revolutionizing Odor Detection with AI and IBM Watsonx
üåê Project Overview
We are currently witnessing a technological renaissance. Machines today can see, hear, touch, and even learn. But there remains one critical human sense they cannot emulate: the sense of smell. This missing sensory dimension represents a major gap in machine perception, especially in industries where chemical, biological, or environmental threats must be detected proactively. To address this challenge, our team, Astrosit, developed SmellControl, a cutting-edge AI-integrated odor detection platform that leverages nanohybrid sensor technology and is fully integrated with IBM Watsonx.ai and IBM Cloud.

üî¨ Technological Foundations
SmellControl is built upon a 64-channel nanohybrid gas sensor array, which mimics the human olfactory system by reacting to molecular compounds and converting these chemical interactions into unique digital signal patterns. The core sensing unit, Smell iX16, is capable of detecting gas concentrations in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range, offering sensitivity up to 100 times greater than traditional sensors.

The sensor array records changes in resistance across 64 independent channels every 1.8 seconds, producing over 6,000 signal data points per gas event during a 5-hour observation cycle. These signals are classified using advanced machine learning models, ensuring high-resolution real-time odor profiling.

Key specifications:

Sensor type: Nanohybrid-based gas detection (Smell iX16)

Total channels: 64 (4 √ó Smell iX16 chips)

Data acquisition rate: 1.8 sec/sample

Weight: ~3.7 grams (fully portable)

Power consumption: ~1 ¬µW (ultra-low power)

Data collected: Tens of thousands of structured signal patterns

Accuracy: ~98% classification success using K-NN model

Output: Digitized odor pattern mapped to AI-driven odor profiles

üß† AI Models & Data Pipeline
The system utilizes a modular data pipeline consisting of:

Real-time data acquisition from the 64-channel sensor

Noise filtering and normalization via statistical preprocessing

Pattern recognition via supervised learning models

Cloud-based classification and logging

During development, we benchmarked several machine learning algorithms on the dataset, including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

Decision Trees

Gradient Boosting Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Logistic Regression

AdaBoost

After comparative testing, K-NN emerged as the top performer with:

F1-score: 0.97

Precision: 0.96

Recall: 0.98

These models are deployed using IBM Watsonx.ai, which enables scalable training, continuous monitoring, and real-time inference. Additionally, ModelArts pipelines were tested for scalable retraining and data labeling efficiency.

‚òÅÔ∏è IBM Cloud & Watsonx Integration
One of the project‚Äôs pivotal breakthroughs is its seamless integration with IBM Cloud and Watsonx.ai. Sensor outputs are streamed to IBM Cloud using MQTT protocols and stored within IBM Object Storage, which acts as a scalable and secure data lake for odor signal patterns.

Within Watsonx, we established a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline tailored for odor classification and environmental risk prediction. The RAG system allows our model to cross-reference historical odor datasets, facilitating:

Pattern-based anomaly detection

Time-series forecasting

Environmental impact assessment

Watsonx is not only used for prediction but also as a knowledge enrichment tool, allowing us to build a dynamic, evolving odor database. Just as the human brain refines its perception of scent through repeated exposure, Watsonx evolves and classifies each new odor with increasing accuracy.

üåé Climate Impact & Sustainability
SmellControl is not just a technical project‚Äîit's an environmental mission. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution causes over 7 million premature deaths annually and leads to economic losses exceeding $80 billion due to industrial accidents, toxic exposure, and long-term health degradation.

Moreover, toxic emissions and gas leaks contribute up to 15% of global carbon emissions. By providing real-time detection of:

Methane (CH‚ÇÑ)

Nitrogen oxides (NO‚Çì)

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Formaldehyde, ammonia, and more

...SmellControl acts as a first line of defense against environmental threats.

This makes the technology particularly suited for:

Smart cities and sustainable urban planning

Carbon footprint monitoring in industry

Waste treatment and agricultural toxin detection

Indoor air quality assurance in residential and public buildings

By enabling automated odor recognition and AI-driven decision making, we empower stakeholders to act swiftly, reducing emissions, preventing disasters, and preserving public health.

üß© Use Case Scenarios
Disaster Management: Detecting gas leaks during earthquakes or industrial failures

Environmental Monitoring: VOC sensing in agriculture and forestry

Military & Defense: Identifying biological and chemical warfare gases

Healthcare: Smell-based diagnostics for neurological diseases

IoT Devices: Smart homes, wearables, and mobile sniffers

üìà Market Viability
The global gas detection market is valued at $600 billion, growing annually by ~7% CAGR. SmellControl targets 3‚Äì5% market share in the first five years, equating to $510‚Äì850 million in projected revenue.

We support the following business models:

B2B: Direct device licensing to industrial sectors

B2G: Government integration for environmental and security monitoring

B2C: Future consumer-grade odor devices for smart homes and health monitoring

Consultancy: Data-driven environmental consulting using our odor datasets

üîó Contribution to SDGs
SmellControl is fully aligned with six UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

SDG 13: Climate Action

SDG 15: Life on Land

üß† Conclusion
SmellControl represents a technological leap that brings machines one step closer to achieving full sensory integration. By incorporating AI-powered olfactory sensing into IBM‚Äôs cloud and machine learning stack, we are not just solving a technical problem‚Äîwe are closing the sensory gap between man and machine.

In an era of escalating climate crisis, urban toxicity, and industrial complexity, SmellControl is more than an innovation‚Äîit's a necessity.
